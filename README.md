## Objective 🎯
The goal of this project is to analyse the heart disease occurrence, based on a combination of features that describes the heart disease.

## Problem Statement
The current market is flooded with a vast number of books, making it challenging for readers to discover new books that align with their interests and preferences. With so many options, it's difficult for readers to find the books that will truly captivate and engage them. As a result, many books go unread and undiscovered, despite having the potential to be appreciated and loved by the right audience.

Additionally, the traditional methods of promoting books, such as advertisements and bestseller lists, are often not personalized and may not effectively reach the intended audience. This can lead to a lack of engagement and disinterest in reading, which can be detrimental to both the publishing industry and literacy efforts.

To address these challenges, there is a need for a book recommendation system that can personalize recommendations and help readers discover new books that align with their interests and preferences. This system can provide valuable insights into reader behavior, promoting literacy and increasing the visibility and engagement of books that might otherwise go unnoticed.
